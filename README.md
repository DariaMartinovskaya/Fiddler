# Fiddler

Fiddler is a cross-platform proxy server app for HTTP debugging. It allows users to view HTTP, HTTPS, and enabled TCP port traffic accessed from, to, or through the local computer. This includes requests and responses, including HTTP headers and metadata (such as cookies, caching, and information encoding), with features designed to help testers analyze connections and exchange messages.
